Deep learning project and research paper in the field of condition monitoring.

Abstract:
Predictive health maintenance in automobiles is soon a necessity fueled by the evolution of autonomous vehicles. Data driven approaches are popularly being used for vehicle maintenance to discover anomalies and predict malfunctions. Health monitoring systems in an automobile can be employed for brakes, suspension elements, tyres, and components of an engine. Brake system is one of the critical components of an automobile which must be supervised regularly to avoid serious consequences during driving. Brake disc is one of the contributing factors to complaints about faulty brake systems. Brake disc are damaged due to cracks formed either as a result of thermal stresses which arise because of sudden braking or due to high braking cycles. An intelligent system which can monitor the condition of brake system using CNN with the help of images of brake disc is discussed. A dataset of disc images is prepared from the videos of brake disc captured at varying accelerations in a test reg in addition to static images captured with varying scale, rotation and background. Performance of pre-trained CNN models is tested on the dataset of disc images in order to identify a healthy or a unhealthy disc.
